NOTE: the output is a little hot, so depending on your audio
setup, it may clip within your system's mixer. To fix this,
just turn down the volume of the application.

The included flac recording is the raw output of the program
but mixed down to 2 channels and 44.1KHz and faded out after
4 minutes.

To build:
$ python3 mkpatchtab.py script.py
requires nasm
